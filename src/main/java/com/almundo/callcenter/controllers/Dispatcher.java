     *  The Thread Pool pattern helps to save resources in a multithreaded application, 
     *  and also to contain the parallelism in certain predefined limits. When you use a thread pool, you write 
     *  your concurrent code in the form of parallel tasks and submit them for execution to an instance 
     *  of a thread pool. This instance controls several re-used threads for executing these tasks.
     *  The pattern allows you to control the number of threads the application is creating, their lifecycle, 
     *  as well as to schedule tasksâ€™ execution and keep incoming tasks in a queue.
     *  In this way we can have 10 concurrent calls (threads) in our callCenter (Dispacht), waiting to be attended by 
     *  an employee. In case of having more than 10 concurrent calls, the surplus of calls comes to be queued in 
     *  the queue (BlockingQueue) that ThreadPoolExecutor handles, so that then the calls can be taken from that 
     *  queue and be able to be assigned and be attended by an employee
